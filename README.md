# 582-jon-project2

## Project description

This project is meant as a tool for parks department employees to update the status of parks and events in order to communicate that information to the public. Public users can see their local parks, what events are taking place in each park, and bookmark events to remind themselves.

## Project functionality

On the admin side, clients will be able to add new parks to the already-existing list of parks, update information about existing parks (facilities, possible closures), delete parks if parks are shut down, and add events to parks.

On the user side, clients will be able to view which parks are in their neighborhood, what kind of facilities they could expect at that park, what events might be taking place now or in the future, and they would be able to bookmark those events to serve as reminders if an event interests them.
